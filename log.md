# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued the labs associated with Angela Yu's Udemy IOS Course. All of the labs today were associated with git. Section 18. https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp

**Thoughts** I understand git as I have previously used it. These lessons did highlight git commands that i could take advantage ove that I wasnt using previously.
